**Hello!** I'm a *self-learner* developer focused on *PHP* and *Laravel PHP Framework*. I design web sites and develop web applications as a full stack developer: Content management systems, e-commerce solutions, APIs etc... I've been coding for 15 years (started in 1992-93 actually, with BASIC and Turbo Pascal but I forgot mostly what I know while they disappeared in the ash heap of history.) using Laravel since 2013 and continue to learn without losing my enthusiasm. Even though I don't use all of them, I know of current technologies and I always follow them. I'm learning *Python* and *Go* as side languages to support my development life. I'm in favor of choosing the right tool for the right job and care about writing code that people can read, not just machines. Docker is my development environment, I'm using GIT and interested (to learn) in cloud services like *Amazon AWS*, *Microsoft Azure* etc.

In my spare time, I help people about **Laravel PHP Framework** and general programming in *Laravel Turkish Community* forums as forum moderator (https://laravel.gen.tr). I have no CS degree but I'm a talkative guy who studied Sociology, interested in Japanese language and culture, anime, music (City Pop mostly), cinema (mostly sci-fi and horror)… which means there's a lot to talk about.
